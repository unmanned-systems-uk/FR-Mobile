🚀 Complete Logging System Features:
1. Logger Header (include/utils/logger.h)

Multiple log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
Dual output: Console + SD card simultaneously
Thread-safe: Mutex protection for concurrent access
Asynchronous logging: Background thread prevents blocking
File rotation: Automatic rotation by size/time with backup files
Timestamp integration: Uses your RTC or network time
Component-based: Each module logs with its own identifier

2. Logger Implementation (src/utils/logger.cpp)

Color-coded console output: Different colors for each log level
Professional file formatting: Structured, parseable log files
Error recovery: Handles file write failures gracefully
Memory efficient: Configurable buffer sizes and limits
Cross-platform: Works on ESP32, Linux, Windows

3. WiFi Scanner with Logging (src/scanners/wifi_scanner.cpp)

Detailed operation logging: Every step tracked and logged
Error diagnostics: Comprehensive error reporting with context
Performance metrics: Scan counts, timing, success rates
Debug information: Packet details, MAC filtering, validation

4. Main Application Integration

System health monitoring: Battery, storage, network status
Startup/shutdown logging: Complete system lifecycle tracking
Error recovery: Intelligent error handling with detailed logs
Configuration logging: All settings recorded at startup

🎯 Key Benefits:
For Development:
cpp// Easy debugging with different levels
LOG_DEBUG("WiFiScanner", "Processing packet with RSSI: " + std::to_string(rssi));
LOG_INFO("BatteryMonitor", "Battery level: 85%");
LOG_ERROR("CellularManager", "Failed to connect to network");
For Field Deployment:

Remote diagnostics: Detailed logs on SD card for field analysis
Problem tracking: Timestamps help correlate issues with events
Performance monitoring: Track system behavior over time
Maintenance planning: Log data helps predict component failures

For Production:

Configurable verbosity: Reduce console output, maintain file logs
Automatic rotation: Prevents SD card from filling up
Error escalation: Critical errors logged immediately, others buffered

📋 Usage Examples:
Basic Logging:
cppLOG_INFO("MyComponent", "Operation completed successfully");
LOG_ERROR("MyComponent", "Failed to read sensor data");
Formatted Logging:
cppLOGF_INFO("BatteryMonitor", "Battery: %d%% (%.2fV, %.1f°C)", 
          soc, voltage, temperature);
Conditional Logging:
cpp#ifdef DEBUG_MODE
LOG_DEBUG("WiFiScanner", "Detailed packet analysis: " + packetDetails);
#endif
🔧 Configuration Options:
cpp// Set log levels
logger->setConsoleLogLevel(LogLevel::WARNING);  // Only warnings+ on console
logger->setFileLogLevel(LogLevel::DEBUG);       // Everything to file

// Configure file rotation
logger->setMaxFileSize(1024 * 1024);  // 1MB files
logger->setMaxBackupFiles(10);        // Keep 10 backups

// Enable async logging for performance
logger->setAsyncLogging(true);
